# DeepFake Analysis and Predictor

## Overview:

A complete end-to-end pipeline for detecting DeepFakes using:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for face image artifacts

- Frequency-domain analysis (FFT + spectrograms) for synthetic voice patterns

- Head motion vector extraction for physical consistency detection

- Robust evaluation under adversarial perturbations (noise, compression, blur)

- A multimodal fusion classifier combining all signals
